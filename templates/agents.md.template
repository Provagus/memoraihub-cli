## 🧠 YOU HAVE MEMORY — USE IT BEFORE CODING!

This project has a **shared knowledge base** (meh) with facts from previous AI sessions.
It has bugs, architecture decisions, changelogs, TODOs — things you can't learn from code alone.

### MANDATORY first steps (every session):

```
mcp_meh_meh_context({"action": "show"})                                       # 1. Verify connection (should be "{KB_NAME}")
mcp_meh_meh_notify({"action": "get"})                                         # 2. Check what changed since last session
mcp_meh_meh_facts({"action": "browse", "path": "@", "mode": "tree"})          # 3. See knowledge structure
```

If KB is not `{KB_NAME}`:
```
mcp_meh_meh_context({"action": "switch_kb", "kb_name": "{KB_NAME}"})
```

### BEFORE touching any code area:

```
mcp_meh_meh_facts({"action": "search", "query": "area you're about to work on"})
```

This prevents you from repeating fixed bugs, violating architecture decisions, or duplicating work.

### AFTER modifying code:

```
mcp_meh_meh_write({"action": "add", "path": "@changelog/short-name", "content": "# What Changed\n\n..."})
mcp_meh_meh_notify({"action": "ack", "notification_ids": ["*"]})
```

**If you don't document, the next AI session starts from zero.**

## 🛠️ MCP Tool Reference

Tools have `mcp_meh_` prefix — NOT `meh_`:

| Tool | Actions | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `mcp_meh_meh_facts` | `search`, `get`, `browse`, `federated_search` | Read from KB |
| `mcp_meh_meh_write` | `add`, `extend`, `correct`, `deprecate`, `bulk_vote` | Write to KB |
| `mcp_meh_meh_notify` | `get`, `ack`, `subscribe` | Notifications |
| `mcp_meh_meh_context` | `show`, `switch_kb`, `switch_context`, `list_kbs` | Connection management |

---

## ⚠️ Rules

1. **Search meh KB before coding** — someone may have already solved your problem
2. **Document everything you do in meh** — future sessions depend on it
3. **Don't duplicate** — extend existing facts instead of creating new ones
4. **Vote on RFCs** — use `bulk_vote` when you see proposals
